# Development Rules

## Documentation Standards
- Avoid unnecessary documentation
- Keep all documentation concise and readable in one pass
- Write so any developer can understand immediately

## Completion Standards
Do not respond that work is complete unless:
- All changes are implemented in code
- All changes are tested on the live production website
- All changes are deployed to production (Vercel)
- All functionality works correctly in production

## Workflow Standards
- If any requirement is not met, continue fixing silently
- Do not ask follow-up questions to the user
- Iterate internally until all requirements are satisfied
- Only respond when everything works correctly on production

## Code Quality
- Write production-ready code
- Test all changes before deployment
- Ensure mobile and desktop compatibility
- Verify all database operations complete successfully
